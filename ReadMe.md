# Summary
This is the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data reduced to just the variables containing the means and standard deviations.  Train and test data sets were appended together and variable names were cleaned up.  Data sets: maindataset.csv and avg_by_subj_activity.csv (made from the maindataset.csv data) were created.
# Files
## ReadMe.md
This file.  It describes the other files in this repository
## CodeBook.md
Describes the original data and how it is transformed.  Also describes each of the variables in the resulting data sets.
## run_analysis.R
The script that was used to transform the original data into the two datasets: maindataset.csv and avg_by_subj_activity.csv
## maindataset.csv
The main dataset containing all the variables described in the code book.
## avg_by_subj_activity.csv
Using the main data set, the average was computed of all of the variables by subject and activity.
